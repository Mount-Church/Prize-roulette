## Known Security Considerations

### Dependencies

Prize Roulette relies on several third-party dependencies. We regularly update these dependencies to address known security vulnerabilities. You can check for known vulnerabilities in our dependencies using:

npm audit
```

Sensitive configuration should be stored in environment variables and not committed to version control. The `.env.example` file documents the required environment variables.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

We implement a strict Content Security Policy to mitigate common web vulnerabilities. The policy is defined in the `vite.config.ts` file.

## Security Updates
